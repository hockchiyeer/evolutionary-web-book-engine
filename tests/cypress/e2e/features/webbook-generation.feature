Feature: Web-Book Engine Evolution Pipeline
  As a principal system tester
  I want reliable BDD coverage across ingestion, fallback routing, artifacts, exports, and history
  So that the Evolutionary Web-Book Engine remains stable under deterministic Cypress runs

  Background:
    Given I clear Web browser cookies

  Scenario: Idle application state exposes the expected controls and empty history
    When I navigate to "DEV" URL and close cookies pop up window
    Then I verify title is "Evolutionary Web Book Engine"
    And I should see "engine_title" is displayed on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "targeted_ingestion_section" is displayed on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "search_input" is enabled on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "search_button" is enabled on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "fallback_mode_select" is displayed on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "gemini_model_select" is displayed on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see fallback mode is set to "google_duckduckgo"
    And I should see Gemini model is set to "gemini-3.1-pro-preview"
    And I should see "status_label" text displayed in "idle" on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "generation_number" text displayed in "0" on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "pop_size_number" text displayed in "0" on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "evolutionary_metrics_section" is displayed on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should see "webbook_viewer_placeholder" is displayed on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    And I should not see "export_menu_button" on "WebBookEngine_Page"
    When I click "history_button" on "WebBookEngine_Page"

  Scenario Outline: Fallback selector supports every supported mode
    When I navigate to "DEV" URL and close cookies pop up window

    Then I should see fallback mode is set to "<mode>"
    And I verify the text "<helper_text>" is displayed on the webpage
    And I should see "search_input" is enabled on "WebBookEngine_Page"

    Examples:
      | mode              | helper_text                                                                                                           |
      | google_duckduckgo | Used only if Gemini needs recovery or supplemental search evidence.                                                   |
      | google            | Used only if Gemini needs recovery or supplemental search evidence.                                                   |
      | duckduckgo        | Used only if Gemini needs recovery or supplemental search evidence.                                                   |
      | off               | Gemini-only mode. No Google Search or DuckDuckGo recovery will run if Gemini search or extraction fails.              |
